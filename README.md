# Golden State Class Exercise

----
## Steps
0. Register to GitHub
0. Install Git
0. Set up the username and email
0. In GitHub, create a new public repository called `golden-state-exercise`
0. Once you created the repo, you'll be redirected to a page that tells you your options on how to get started writing code. Under `Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before` make sure you have `HTTPS` selected, and copy the link it gives you.
0. In your Terminal / Git Bash navigate to your `Development` or your `Documents` folder.
0. Run `git clone {the link you copied}`
0. Navigate inside the `golden-state-exercise` folder that you just copied.
0. Create an `index.html`, a `style.css` and a `README.md` file
0. Create the first commit:
  0. From [this Codepen file](https://codepen.io/amina_karl/pen/mdVJqgo), copy the HTML to the `index.html`, the CSS to the `style.css`, and the comment in the JS section, to the `README.md` file.
  0. Link the CSS file to the HTML
  0. Open it in the browser to make sure it looks OK
  0. Run `git add .` to add all the changes
  0. Create the commit using: `git commit -m "initial commit"`
  0. Push the changes using: `git push`
0. Publish your website using Github Pages
0. The next feature we'll create will be the header:
  0. Give it a navigation bar. Give it 3 navigation list items. What they are is up to you.
  0. Center the navigation both horizontally and vertically.
  0. Change the background of the `<header>` from pink to `#f2f2f2`
  0. Add these changes to your repository with an appropriate commit message, for example: "building out the navigation"
0. Next we'll add an image to the website:
  0. The element with the `image` class is empty. Make sure this element takes up the full width of the `main` element and it's 200px tall. 
  0. Give it a background-image and position/size it until it looks good.
  0. Add these changes to your repository with an appropriate commit message.
0. Next we'll add some text to the columns.
  0. Add a 10px padding for the 3 columns.
  0. Add some lorem ipsum text to all 3: `https://www.lipsum.com/`
  0. Remove the height and the background color from them.
0. Next is the `<footer>`:
  0. Give 10px padding to the footer.
  0. Add a font-awesome icon to the bottom left side.
  0. Remove the background color from the footer and make the icon purple.
